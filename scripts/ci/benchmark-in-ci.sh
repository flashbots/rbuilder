# This script runs the benchmarks and prepares a customized report.
#
# Primary use-case is running in (GitHub) CI, but can also run locally.
#
# Benchmarks can be run in two modes:
# 1. Basic mode: Run the benchmarks for the current commit only (used if HEAD_SHA == BASE_SHA)
# 2. Comparison mode: Run the benchmarks for the current commit and a target commit, and compare them (to see the specific improvements)
#
# Important variables are sourced from ./env-vars.sh, which combines local git information with Github specific variables and methods.
#
# Useful environment variables (to possibly override):
# - X_HEAD_SHA: custom head sha (for dev purposes)
# - X_BASE_SHA: custom base sha (which is run first, and the head benchmark compared against)
# - SKIP_BENCH: skip running `cargo bench` (just generates the HTML based on the previous benchmark).
