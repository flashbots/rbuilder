## Contributing to rbuilder

Welcome to the Flashbots collective!

Thanks for your help improving `rbuilder`! We are so happy to have you! We just ask you to be nice when you play with us.

Please start by reading our [license agreement](#individual-contributor-license-agreement) below, and our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct).

The [dev Telegram](https://t.me/flashbots_rbuilder) is available for any questions and concerns you may have that are not covered in the documentation.

If you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under both Apache 2.0 and the MIT
license.

### Ways to contribute

There are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:

1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug
   in `rbuilder`, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues,
   such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.
3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either
   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often,
   by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and
   reviewable manner.

**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and
participate in reviewing PRs.

### Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar

At the moment, we discourage contributions that only fix spelling or grammatical errors in documentation, code or
elsewhere.

### Code style

Start by making sure that your code is readable, consistent, and pretty.
Follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/) recommendations.

### Send a pull request

- Your proposed changes should be first described and discussed in an issue.
- Open the branch in a personal fork, not in the team repository.
- Every pull request should be small and represent a single change. If the problem is complicated, split it in multiple issues and pull requests.
- Every pull request should include one or more tests to ensure that rbuilder does not regress in the future.

We appreciate you, friend <3.

    * "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Flashbots for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Flashbots (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Flashbots or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Flashbots for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Flashbots and to recipients of software distributed by Flashbots a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works, under the terms of the license which the project is using on the Submission Date.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Flashbots, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Flashbots.
5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Flashbots separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
8. You agree to notify Flashbots of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
